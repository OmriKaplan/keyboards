Core functionality only requires diodes, hotswap sockets, and a pro-micro compatible controller.

Controller must be soldered on face-down.  
I highly recommend socketing the controller.

The black strips are .063", adhesive-backed neoprene foam. They provide support while inserting switches, and slightly damp the acoustics of the assembly.

The switchplate is not necessary, but I like the added functionality of the 2u stabilizer, as well as the added support provided to the switches.

Backlighting:  
Solder mosfet, pull-down resistor (4.7kohm), and led resistors as shown.  
You must choose whether you want for the +V power source to come from the VCC pin, or the RAW (24th) pin of the controller.

Align triangle corner of the led with the white corner of the pad.

Bluetooth controller (such as nice!nano):  
There are pads on the PCB so that the battery power can be run across an external power switch (also built into the pcb)
