## Integrated Switchplate Installation:
![pl02](https://imgur.com/rf00MOk.jpg)  
Rubber-band the PCB & switchplate together (alignment is not important here)  
![pl04](https://imgur.com/YXEz9BZ.jpg)
![pl06](https://imgur.com/uqOw5hI.jpg)  
Insert a few switches (to align the switchplate), but do not raise the switchplate to clip to the switches.  
Leave the switchplate in direct contact with the pcb, the way the rubber-bands are holding them.  
![pl08](https://imgur.com/7fxtDv0.jpg)  
Flip the assembly to rest on the switches.  
![pl10](https://imgur.com/ioVZ6hr.jpg)
Apply solder to the joint-holes in-between the switches (this is what holds the pcb & plate together)  
There are twelve.
