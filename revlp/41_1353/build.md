## Integrated Switchplate Installation:

Rubber-band the PCB & switchplate together (alignment is not important here)

Insert a few switches (to align the switchplate), but do not raise the switchplate to clip to the switches.  
Leave the switchplate in direct contact with the pcb, the way the rubber-bands are holding them.

Flip the assembly to rest on the switches.

Apply solder to the joint-holes in-between the switches (this joins the pcb & plate together)  
There are twelve.

Install inserts into keycap with the offset toward the front  
& install the bar into the inserts with the bend away from the cap-edge
