Initial version notes:

Design:
- Diodes can be mounted under switches, or onto back of PCB
- Switchplate can be soldered to PCB or clipped to switches (depending on desired keycap clearance)
- Use of the switchplate prevents opening of switches while soldered

switchplate pcb issues from initial batch:
- switch cutouts should be 13.95mm square
- 2u cutout seems not centered (needs confirmation)
- 2u cutout should be 2mm wider
- 2u cutout can be 1mm less deep
- PCB-connection points should be through-hole OR connected to the flood-pad (smaller SMD pads are too easy to lift)
- Thickness (differs per application)
  - 1.6mm when switch clip-in (this option has poor cap compatibility, but looks stellar when applicable)
  - 1.2mm when solder-to-PCB (provides maximum cap compatibility. 1.6mm works, but is awfully close)
