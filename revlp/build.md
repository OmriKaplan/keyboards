Core functionality only requires diodes, hotswap sockets, and a pro-micro compatible controller.

Controller must be soldered on face-down.  
I highly recommend socketing the controller.

Switchplate is not necessary, but I personally like the added support that the switchplate provides for the switches, as well as the added functionality of the 2u stabilizer.  
The black strips are .063", adhesive-backed neoprene foam. They change the acoustics of the assembly but not much beyond that.

Backlighting:  
Solder mosfet, pull-down resistor (4.7kohm), and led resistors as shown.  
You must choose whether you want for the +V power source to come from the VCC pin, or the RAW (24th) pin of the controller.

Align triangle corner of the led with the white corner of the pad.

Bluetooth controller (such as nice!nano):  
There are pads on the PCB so that the battery power can be run across an external power switch (also built into the pcb)
